# Horiseon Landing page Refactor
## Description
This is the landing page for the Horiseon Marketing Agency .

It is built using HTML and CSS.

### Challenges
* Code that was difficult to read .
   
    When first starting the project i was faced with an html file with almost no semantic elements, the first thing that i did was change the tags for ones that better fit their role.

* Confusing CSS.

    The CSS file required me to scroll back and fort in order to cahnge the style rules so i organized them to follow the order of the html.
    
    The CSS file wasnt using classes in an eficient way, so i deleted the blocks that were unnecessary

I made a point to clean the code as much as i could so that i could learn more about best practices as well as SEO and how some css selectors work
